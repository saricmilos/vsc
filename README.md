# Voltage Source Converters and Power Converters Projects

This repository contains the projects I developed as part of my university courses, **"Electric Energy Conversions"** and **"Analysis of Modern Converter-based Power Systems"**. These projects include implementations that I have developed independently.

## Projects Overview

1. **Electric Energy Conversions**: This section includes 7 laboratory exercises (PDFs) demonstrating different aspects of energy conversion processes, with a focus on power converter and their applications.

2. **Analysis of Modern Converter-based Power Systems**: This section includes a comprehensive report (PDF) on the Principles of Voltage Source Converter Control Using Clarke and Park Transformations.

## Disclaimer
These projects were developed as part of my university courses **"Electric Energy Conversions"** and **"Analysis of Modern Converter-based Power Systems"**. However, all code, simulations, and implementations were done independently by me. No university-owned materials were used or included in these projects.

The purpose of sharing these projects is to provide educational content and showcase my independent work. Reproduction, use in research, or redistribution for commercial purposes is not permitted without my explicit permission.

The concepts and techniques used in this project were learned from the following sources and the images included in this repository were taken from:
- **"VOLTAGE-SOURCED CONVERTERS IN POWER SYSTEMS: Modeling, Control, and Applications"** by [Amirnaser Yazdani], [Reza Iravani]
- **"Power Electronics"** by [Daniel W. Hart]

These books were instrumental in helping me understand the underlying principles of power electronics and converters.


In addition, the MATLAB models and simulation methods provided by my professor Eduardo Prieto Araujo in the course **[Analysis of Modern Converter-based Power Ayatem]** were used as learning resources to help understand and implement specific VSC control models. These models were adapted to suit the requirements of this project and were originally developed by the course instructor.
